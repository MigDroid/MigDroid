I have a $$$category$$$ Android app (target app) and I want to test this functionality of it:
$$$func$$$

Now, I provide a test skeleton that is used to test the same functionality of another app (source app). 
The skeleton is written in natural language, formed by a series of semantic steps.
By semantic steps, I mean the steps are organized according to human habits, and each step could be completed by one or several interactions.
Note that the skeleton is a good reference, but it may not cover all the steps needed for testing our app. There could be some extra interactions needed before or after a semantic step to set up or handle app-specific behavior.
So it is just provided for you to understand how the test is conducted in a general way; no need to follow it strictly.
Test Skeleton for Source App:
$$$src_test_desc$$$

A tip about the skeleton: Each skeleton step contains two parts. The first part is the intention of the step, and the second part is the detailed operations to complete the step. You should achieve the intention of the steps, but no need to follow the detailed operations strictly, since the detailed operations are based on the source app, not our app.

Now I am interacting with our app to test its functionality. I have executed the following interactions:
$$$event_history_desc$$$
The effect of each interaction is shown in the screenshot attached. 

Now as a routine check, you need to analyze whether there is any interaction in the flow that is wrong, which means it misleads the app to a wrong state. If there is, you need to identify the earliest wrong interaction. However, you should pick an interaction that is as late as possible, which means the interaction you choose should be as close to the tail of the interaction flow as possible.
If there is no wrong interaction, you should output "0".
Your answer should strictly follow this format:
Interaction consequence analysis: [Analyze the consequences of each executed interaction according to the screenshots, and analyze whether it has deviated from the expected interaction flow. Use no more than 30 words for each interaction.]
Late Earliest wrong interaction: [The id of the earliest wrong interaction. Put only a number here. If no wrong interaction is found, put 0 here.];
