I have a $$$category$$$ Android app (target app) and I want to test this functionality of it:
$$$func$$$

A test skeleton written for another app (source app) with a similar functionality is provided for soft reference.
Test Skeleton for Source App:
$$$src_test_desc$$$

A tip about the skeleton: Each skeleton step contains two parts. The first part is the intention of the step, and the second part is the detailed operations to complete the step. You should achieve the intention of the steps, but no need to follow the detailed operations strictly, since the detailed operations are based on the source app, not our app.

Now I am interacting with our app step by step to test its functionality.
$$$event_history_desc$$$

The completeness of skeleton steps is as follows:
$$$skeleton_completeness$$$

This is the skeleton step I am currently working on:
Among them, "step in progress" means the step needs multiple interactions to finish, and it is in the middle.
"Step to start" means the step is just about to start, without any interaction executed yet.
"Extra Interaction" means the interaction needed before starting a new step to set up or handle app-specific behavior. If it is not None, I should execute it before the step to start.
$$$step_status$$$

Just now, I performed a new interaction on the widget highlighted with a red box to advance the current skeleton step:
$$$current_interaction$$$

Before this interaction, the app's screen appeared as shown on the left side of the attached image, with the target widget marked in red.
After the interaction, the screen transitioned to the state shown on the right side of the image.

Your task is to analyze this interaction and determine whether it should be accepted.
a. What are the consequences of this interaction?
b. How is this interaction related to the test?
c. Should this interaction be accepted? Accept interactions that help advance the current step, initiate the next step, serve as preparatory steps leading up to a skeleton step, or handle tutorials and pop-ups that need to be handled before the skeleton step. Interactions should be rejected only if they lead the test in an incorrect direction.

Now please describe the interaction I just executed, your answer should strictly follow this format:
Consequences: [Describe the consequences of the new interaction with no more than 20 words.]
Progress Reasoning: [Analyze whether this interaction has progressed the current skeleton step or a potential connection to the next step, use no more than 30 words.]
Interaction Description: [Describe the new interaction, follow this format: Interaction: {Action(if the action is to input, you should mention the input content here)} {Subject(You should describe the subject with your own words, no more than 5 words)} to {Intention}, the effect of this interaction is {Consequences(no more than 20 words, you should describe the consequences based on the difference between the two screenshots.)}.]
Reason for accepting/rejecting the interaction: [Give a brief reasoning on why you choose to accept or reject the interaction. Use no more than 30 words.]
Whether to Accept: [Yes/No] (Choose one)
Reject Type: [Incorrect Action on the Correct Subject Widget/Incorrect Subject Widget, Put "None" here if you choose to accept the interaction.] (Choose one)
