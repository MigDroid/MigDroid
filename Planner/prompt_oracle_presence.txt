I have a $$$category$$$ Android app (target app) and I want to test this functionality of it:
$$$func$$$

Now, I provide a test skeleton that is used to test the same functionality of another app (source app). 
The skeleton is written in natural language, formed by a series of semantic steps.
By semantic steps, I mean the steps are organized according to human habits, and each step could be completed by one or several interactions.
Test Skeleton for Source App:
$$$src_test_desc$$$

After executing these steps on the source app, it is navigated to the screen shown in the left side of the image attached. 
An anchor widget is annotated with a red box. The anchor widget is used to confirm the completion of the test with its presence.
The anchor widget is described as follows:
$$$stop_condition$$$

Now I have executed similar steps on the target app. Its screen is shown in the right side of the image attached.
I want to know, for the target app, which widget is the anchor widget for the test?
We have annotated the candidate widgets with red or blue boxes, and their IDs are shown in the screenshot. We also provide their DOM properties for your reference.
The candidate widgets are:
$$$candidates$$$

You should think step by step, first answer these questions, and then tell me which widget is the anchor:
Question 1: Describe the target app's screen (shown in the right side of the image attached).
Question 2: Analyze which widget is the anchor widget for the target app, and why?
Your answer should strictly follow this format:
Target App Screen Description: [describe the target app's screen, use no more than 30 words]
Anchor Widget Inference: [Provide an analysis on which widget is the anchor widget for the target app, and why. Use no more than 30 words]
Anchor Widget ID: [The unique id of the anchor widget. Put only a number here.]
