I have a GUI test written for a $$$category$$$ Android app.

Here are the test steps:
$$$test_steps$$$

After the interactions, the tester should check whether the test is complete or not, according to the following stop condition:
Stop Condition: $$$stop_condition$$$

When the app is just opened, the screen is shown as the leftmost side of the attached image.
The app's screen after executing each interaction is shown in the attached image, from left to right.

You should think step by step. According to the app's screens, do you think some of the steps can be better described?

Your answer should strictly follow the format below:
Interaction Steps:
1. [step's intention and operation]. [This step is grouped from [step number] to [step number].]
2. [step's intention and operation]. [This step is grouped from [step number] to [step number].]
...

Stop Condition: [Follow this format: Got the observation that a {subject type} subject with {feature} has {Appear/Disappear}, it is {describe the subject}.]

Functionality Under Test: [The functionality being tested by the script. Use no more than 30 words]
