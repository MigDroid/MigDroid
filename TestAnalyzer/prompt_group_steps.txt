I have a GUI test written for a $$$category$$$ Android app.
The functionality under test is: $$$fut$$$

Here are the interaction steps:
$$$interaction_steps$$$

After the interactions, the tester should check whether the test is complete or not, according to the following stop condition:
Stop Condition: $$$stop_condition$$$

When the app is just opened, the screen is shown as the left side of the attached image.
After executing the interactions, the app's screen is shown as the right side of the attached image.

As above, each of the interaction steps is an atomic interaction. 
Here we define a term "semantic step," which means some of the test steps can be grouped with adjacent steps, forming a semantic step that is semantically meaningful to the functionality under test.

Now convert the test case into the form of semantic steps. It is possible that a semantic step is composed of one or several test steps.

Your answer should strictly follow the format below:
(Guidance for you: Each semantic step should be semantically atomic, that means each step should hold a complete meaning, but each of its sub-step does not. Use no more than 20 words for each step, for input actions, you should include the exact input content in the step)
Semantic Steps:
1. [step's intention and operation].[Detailed operations: summarize the interaction details from the corresponding interaction step(s) here].  This step is grouped from [test step ids].
2. [step's intention and operation].  This step is grouped from [test step ids]
...

Stop Condition: [Follow this format: Got the observation that a {describe the subject} with {feature} has {Appear/Disappear}, it is {describe the subject}.]

Functionality Under Test: [The functionality being tested by the script. Use no more than 30 words]
